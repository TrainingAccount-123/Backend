Write a calculator class that performs 4 functions - add, subtract, multiply and divide
Create a custom exception NotAFloatError that is raised when the user input is not a number
Use proper exception handling techniques to verify the validity of the inputs
write a menu driven main loop to allow the user to perform any of these functions at will

Write a calculator in python that performs add, subtract multiply and divide. write a menu driven main loop with custom exceptions to allow for user interaction




file structure:

arithmetic.py
exceptions.py
main.py


arithmetic.py:
contains class Arithmetic - 
 contains functions add, subtract, multiply, divide
 add - returns the sum of 2 numbers provided as parameters
 subtract - returns the difference of 2 numbers provided as parameters
 multiply - returns the product of 2 numbers provided as parameters
 divide - returns the quotient of 2 numbers provided as parameters. if the second number(denominator) is 0, raises DivisionByZeroError

exceptions.py:
contains custom exceptions class NotANumberError

main.py
valid_input function:
returns a valid input of a numbers when called
validation is done by raising a custom exception
has a while loop till the user enters a valid output

START
main function:
choices given to the user:
add -
 calls the add function from the Arithmetic class object
 asks for input for 2 numbers using the valid_input function
 prints the sum of the two given numbers
 
subtract -
 calls the subtract function from the Arithmetic class object
 asks for input for 2 numbers using the valid_input function
 prints the difference of the second number subtracted from the first number

multiply -
 calls the multiply function from the Arithmetic class object
 asks for input for 2 numbers using the valid_input function
 prints the product of the 2 numbers

divide -
 calls the divide function from the Arithmetic class object
 asks for input for 2 numbers using the valid_input function
 prints the quatient of the first number divided by the second number
 catches DivisionByZeroError if raised





file structure and responsibilities:

arithmetic.py:
- contains a class Arithmetic that defines the functions add, subtract, multiply and divide
- provides the core mathematical operations for the calculator

exceptions.py:
- contains a class NotANumberError that is used as a custom exception
- defines a custom exception that is raised for validation of inputs

main.py:
- contains functions valid_input, main
- interacts with the user


START:

main.py
imports:
-from arithmetic import Arithmetic
-from exceptions import NotANumberError

STEP 1: 
get user input on choice based on the choices provided:
-add
-subtract
-multiply
-divide
-exit

STEP 2: 
on valid choice:
-get input of 2 numbers using the valid_input() function
-valid_input() allows for retries when giving input till the input is a valid operations, and raises the custom exception on invalid input
if choice is exit:
-moves to END

STEP 3:
call the function based on user
-if user choice is add:
--calls add function in Arithmetic class, returning sum of 2 taken inputs
-if user choice is subtract:
--calls subtract function in Arithmetic class, returning difference of 2 taken inputs
-if user choice is multiply:
--calls multiply function in Arithmetic class, returning product of 2 taken inputs
-if user choice is divide:
--calls divide function in Arithmetic class, returning quotient of 2 taken inputs, or Invalid Input if the divisor is 0

STEP 4:
Ask the user if they wish to continue(y/n):
-if y:
--STEP 1
-if n:
--END
if neither of y or n:
--STEP 4
